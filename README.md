### Description

A calendar proogram fully complete with all the works. Keeps track of important dates like birthdays, holidays, etc. It's very useful when you need to remember something important, because every time you log on, you are notified of upcoming events. Includes support for annual, weekly, and even monthly events.

If you want it to pop up every time you log on, you will need to add a Scheduled Task for the program after you compile it.
